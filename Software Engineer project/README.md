# **Talon** Introduction

According to information from Boston Consulting Group in 2018 that says 17 million people in Thailand were in the upper-middle-class so that can be the cause of the rise in the middle class has made Thai tourists flock across Asian countries. Moreover, according to information on Thailand Outbound Travel Report in 2018 that says the population of Thai tourists will be increasing 10 million, so that means in 2018 to 2019 has increased Thai tourists continuously so that information makes us see the opportunity to start a business about traveling. First, we interviewed and researched the pain point of tourists. As a result, we found several problems, for example, spending more time to plan the trip, no idea to traveling, hard to manage time in the trip, disappointing activities, and unfamiliar transportation when traveling in each Country by themself with useful information from the internet so that can be misinformation in the other hand if traveling by traditional travel agencies so it has strict timelines dictated that make boring in traveling from all of this problem, we spent the time to design platform that can solve all of the problems and serve the need of Thai tourist so begin Tal¢n, a platform that can support tourist who want to experience a fast, safety and flexible so we believe Tal¢n is going to change Thai people travel and experience traveling in the way you have never experienced before by Tal¢n offers a new service by using storytelling. Therefore, our services are going to make them feel like adventure and more enjoy a trip, so they can customize by themself which is supported by expert and reliable local guides of each country who guarantee by Talon. For the summary, the Talon platform will improve Thai people traveling and give new experiences in a way that people have never experienced before in a foreign culture.
